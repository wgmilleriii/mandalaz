Hi all - If you have been having any difficulty in using the Piano Tech website to log your work, please simply email me or review this annoucement.Your attendance for 1 hour per week in the piano lab (Tues or Thurs at 5PM), coupled with your independent work logged on the Piano Tech site, are posted as attendance "grades" - so please make sure that you are reporting your work through the app or email. There are two ways to log your work from the app:1. Click "Service"->"Goals", then click the goal you are working on. Pick a piano from the list to work on, and make an evaluation of the tuning (Excellent, Good, or Poor). When you have completed your work, indicate your time spent with "Minimum" (5-15 mins), "Average" (15-30 mins) or "Significant" (>30 mins), and change the tuning status if necessary.2. Click "Service"->"Work", and search for the piano by room or serial number. Click "Record my work" to begin work; you will see your name added to the work history. Finish by indicating time spent - "Minimum" (5-15 mins), "Average" (15-30 mins) or "Significant" (>30 mins) - and leave a comment if you see anything amiss. You can also click "Add Future Checkup" to create a reminder for yourself (Tickets>Mine).Please let me know if you have any questions!
